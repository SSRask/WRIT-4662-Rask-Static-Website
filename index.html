    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>As you may have heard while applying to your position, we write the websites for all CLA departments. We collaborate with each other and with faculty to make department sites more usable for students. A lot of what we do involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Website audits</li>
      <li>Meetings</li>
      <li>Project management</li>
      <li>Frequent communication with department staff and faculty</li>
      <li>Copyediting</li>
      <li>Content development</li>
      <li>Training</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
    <p>Prior to commencing this massive project of recreating all CLA department websites, we hired an outside consultant to conduct an analysis of our old sites. The consultant identified what all department websites had in common, and they figured out what pages supported the most traffic. With this information, we were able to create a common template for all department sites to follow. Meanwhile, this is all being migrated into a single content management system (<abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>). With this, all sites appear connected and follow similar layouts, but there is still room for departments to flex their individuality. Working within a <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> also makes it easier for us to reach and work within any of the sites&mdash;faculty can contribute too!</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a team of CLA web experts attuned to usability and content strategy.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Student Writers</h3>
    <p>First, there is a group of student web writers/editors in the office. You are one of them. We are all technical writing and communications majors, but our subplans vary across the board. The student employee team is often fluctuating due to dispersed graduation dates. We won't keep a list of the students here, but they sit near you in the office, so they'll be pretty easy to meet. Poke your head over the desk dividers and say hello!</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Kelly</h3>
    <p>Kelly is our boss. She is the director of communications, and she likely conducted your interview and hired you. She's in charge of the CLA department website migrations, so she basically knows everything. She conducts website kickoff meetings and helps us get started on new projects, and she'll help you get acquainted with the office.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Simon</h3>
    <p>Simon is our web developer. He knows all the technicalities behind Drupal and how it works, and he's always working to improve how we build webpages.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Colleen</h3>
    <p>Always the first one in the office, Colleen is our full-fledged, faithful web editor. She knows all things publishing, grammar, and AP style, and more importantly, she understands CLA's writing style. She generally works directly with CLA content, but she's always happy to answer any questions you might have on a departmental level.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Katie</h3>
    <p>You won't directly work with her much, but Katie is our social media manager. She develops and implements content strategy for all CLA social media accounts, and she's a digital marketing pro.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>There is a series of tools we often use at work. If you're not already acquainted with Google, we'll make sure you are by the end of the week. Understanding how to use the following tools is necessary to succeeding as a web writer for CLA. Thankfully, most of it isn't too bad.</p>
    <h3>Google Suite</h3>
    <p>Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Draw... We use it all, but don't worry, you won't have to create a new account to use any of these. You can just use your UMN email, and it will connect with any of these apps. We use Google Draw to create site maps of new websites, and we use the resulting hierarchal structure in kickoff meetings with departments. We use Google Calendar to keep track of everyone's work schedules and all of our meetings, and we use Google Drive to organize all of the Google Docs that document our migration process and content.</p>
    <h3>Trello</h3>
    <p><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> helps us organize our projects and keep track of how we're collaborating on them. It's basically just a single page with a bunch of cards stacked on it, and each card represents a project. For example, one card could be for history's website. It would probably be titled "History," and within that card would be a deadline for the sites completion, a to-do checklist, and a section for team comments. With project cards all organized on one page, it makes it easy for us to work together and keep track of the dozens of projects we manage at once.</p>
    <h3>Atom</h3>
    <p><a href="https://atom.io/"> Atom</a> is a text editor you have to download, if it isn't already on your computer. We often use Atom when we have to work with HTML for a large chunk of content, such as when creating accordions and curating course lists. Don't worry about this too much now. Simon and the other web writers will help you figure out appropriate situations for using Atom. Just know that it's supposed to make your web-writing tasks easier.</p>
    <h3>Drupal</h3>
    <p>Drupal is the <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> with which we work. Your job is to move all CLA department websites into this system. There's not much you can learn here that will help you with Drupal, unfortuneately. It's a complex system, especially if you've never worked with a <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> before, so it's easiest to learn through experience.</p>
