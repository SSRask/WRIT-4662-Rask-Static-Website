<h2>What We Do</h2>

<p>As you may have heard while applying to your position, we write the websites for all CLA departments. We collaborate with each other and with faculty to make department sites more usable for students. A lot of what we do involves:
  <ul>
    <li>Website audits</li>
    <li>Meetings</li>
    <li>Project management</li>
    <li>Frequent communication with department staff and faculty</li>
    <li>Copyediting</li>
    <li>Content development</li>
    <li>Training</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
Prior to commencing this massive project of recreating all CLA department websites, we hired an outside consultant to conduct an analysis of our old sites. The consultant identified what all department websites had in common, and they figured out what pages supported the most traffic. With this information, we were able to create a common template for all department sites to follow. Meanwhile, this is all being migrated into a single content management system (CMS). With this, all sites appear connected and follow similar layouts, but there is still room for departments to flex their individuality. Working within a CMS also makes it easier for us to reach and work within any of the sites--faculty can help too!

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are a team of CLA web experts attuned to usability and content strategy.</p>

<h3>Student Writers</h3>
<p>First, there is a group of student web writers/editors in the office. You are one of them. We are all Technical Writing and Communications majors, but our subplans vary across the board. The student employee team is often fluctuating due to dispersed graduation dates. We won't keep a list of the students here, but they sit near you in the office, so they'll be pretty easy to meet!</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>There is a series of tools we often use at work. If you're not already acquainted with Google, we'll make sure you are by the end of the week. Understanding how to use the following tools is necessary to succeeding as a web writer for CLA. Thankfully, most of it isn't too bad.</p>
<h3>Google Suite</h3>
<p>Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Draw...</p>
<h3>Trello</h3>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> helps us organize our projects and keep track of how we're collaborating on them. It's basically just a single page with a bunch of cards stacked on it, and each card represents a project. For example, one card could be for history's website. It would probably be titled "History," and within that card would be a deadline for the sites completion, a to-do checklist, and a section for team comments. With project cards all organized on one page, it makes it easy for us to work together and keep track of the dozens of projects we manage at once.</p>
